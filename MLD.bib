abstract = {One method of analyzing radiation and propagation above a surface is to employ an effective surface impedance to describe the effect of the boundary. In this paper an expression is derived for the effective impedance at grazing incidence of a slightly rough interface between air and a finitely conducting medium for which the Leontovich boundary condition is applicable. The perturbation technique of Rayleigh and Rice is employed, and attention is restricted to vertical polarization. The resulting effective surface impedance consists of two terms, the impedance of the lower medium when the surface is perfectly smooth and a term accounting for roughness. The latter term can be complex in general and depends on the strengths of the roughness spectral components present. The result is applicable to either deterministic periodic surfaces or random rough surfaces. Various alternate definitions of the effective surface impedance are examined and are seen to be equivalent. The analysis of power flow at the surface permits the interpretation of the interaction process in terms of scattered fields.},

This paper focuses on the application of HF radar-derived surface current maps to U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue operations along the Mid-Atlantic coast of the USA. In that context, we evaluated two algorithms used to combine maps of radial currents into a single map of total vector currents. In situ data provided by seven drifter deployments and four bottom-mounted current meters were used to (1) evaluate the well-established unweighted least squares (UWLS) and the more recently adapted optimal interpolation (OI) algorithms and (2) quantify the sensitivity of the OI algorithm to varying decorrelation scales and error thresholds. Results with both algorithms were shown to depend on the location within the HF radar data footprint. The comparisons near the center of the HF radar coverage showed no significant difference between the two algorithms. The most significant distinction between the two was seen in the drifter trajectories. With these simulations, the weighting of radial velocities by distance in the OI implementation was very effective at reducing both the distance between the actual drifter and the cluster of simulated particles as well as the scale of the search area that encompasses them. In this study, the OI further reduced the already improved UWLS-based search areas by an additional factor of 2. The results also indicated that the OI output was relatively insensitive to the varying decorrelation scales and error thresholds tested.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Near-inertial currents (NICs) were observed on the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) during the passage of Hurricane Arthur (2014). High-frequency radars showed that the surface currents were weak near the coast but increased in the offshore direction. The NICs were damped out in 3-4 days in the southern MAB but persisted for up to 10 days in the northern MAB. A Slocum glider deployed on the shelf recorded two-layer baroclinic currents oscillating at the inertial frequency. A numerical model was developed to interpret the observed spatial and temporal variabilities of the NICs and their vertical modal structure. Energy budget analysis showed that most of the differences in the NICs between the shelf and the deep ocean were determined by the spatial variations in wind energy input. In the southern MAB, energy dissipation quickly balanced the wind energy input, causing a rapid damping of the NICs. In the northern MAB, however, the dissipation lagged the wind energy input such that the NICs persisted. The model further showed that mode-1 waves dominated throughout the MAB shelf and accounted for over 70{\%} of the current variability in the NICs. Rotary spectrum analyses revealed that the NICs were the largest component of the total kinetic energy except in the southern MAB and the inner shelf regions with strong tides. The NICs were also a major contributor to the shear spectrum over an extensive area of the MAB shelf and thus may play an important role in producing turbulent mixing and cooling of the surface mixed layer.},

Based on numerical simulations with and without the Columbia River (CR) during summer, the directly wind-forced near-inertial surface currents are enhanced by 30{\%}–60{\%} when the near-surface layer has a stratified condition due to riverine water inputs from the CR. Comparing model results without the CR for summer and winter conditions indicates that the directly wind-forced near-inertial surface current response to a unit wind forcing during summer are 20{\%}–70{\%} stronger than those during winter depending on the cross-shore location, which is in contrast to the seasonal patterns of both mixed-layer depth and amplitudes of near-inertial currents. The model simulations are used to exam- ine aspects of coastal inhibition of near-inertial currents, manifested in their spatial coherence in the cross- shore direction, where the phase propagates upward over the continental shelf, bounces at the coast, and continues increasing upward offshore (toward surface) and then downward offshore at the surface, with magnitudes and length scales in the near-surface layer increasing offshore. This pattern exhibits a particu- larly well-organized structure during winter. Similarly, the raypaths of clockwise near-inertial internal waves are consistent with the phase propagation of coherence, showing the influence of upper layer stratification and coastal inhibition.},

abstract = {A high-frequency (HF) radar system is deployed on the New Jersey continental shelf as part of a coastal ocean observatory. The system includes two remote transmit–receive sites in Brant Beach and Brigantine, New Jersey, and a central processing site in Tuckerton, New Jersey. The system uses radio waves scattered off the ocean to measure the radial velocity, range, and bearing of the scattering surface. Calculation of the bearing for HF radar systems depends on the actual beam pattern of the receive antennas. A series of antenna beam pattern measurements conducted on the New Jersey system shows that these patterns are often distorted when an antenna is deployed in the field. Tests indicate that the local environment, not system hardware, causes the most significant distortion of the pattern from the theoretical shape. Correlation with an in situ acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) indicates that the beam pattern distortion can bias the bearing estimate. It is shown that this bias can be removed if the measured beam patterns are used to estimate the bearing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The impact of topographic internal lee wave drag (wave drag hereafter) on several aspects of the low-frequency circulation in a high-resolution global ocean model forced by winds and air-sea buoyancy fluxes is examined here. The HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is run at two different horizontal resolutions (one nominally 1/12° and the other 1/25°). Wave drag, which parameterizes both topographic blocking and the generation of lee waves arising from geostrophic flow impinging upon rough topography, is inserted into the simulations as they run. The parameterization used here affects the momentum equations and hence the structure of eddy kinetic energy. Lee waves also have implications for diapycnal mixing in the ocean, though the parameterization does not directly modify the density. Total near-bottom energy dissipation due to wave drag and quadratic bottom boundary layer drag is nearly doubled, and the energy dissipation due to quadratic bottom drag is reduced by about a factor of two, in simulations with an inserted wave drag compared to simulations having only quadratic bottom drag. With the insertion of wave drag, the kinetic energy is reduced in the abyss and in a three-dimensional global integral. Deflection by partial topographic blocking is inferred to be one reason why the near-bottom kinetic energy can increase in locations where there is little change in dissipation by quadratic bottom drag. Despite large changes seen in the abyss, the changes that occur near the sea surface are relatively small upon insertion of wave drag into the simulations. Both the sea surface height variance and geostrophic surface kinetic energy are reduced on global average by more than twice the seasonal variability in these diagnostics. Alterations in the intensified jet positions brought about by inserting wave drag are not distinguishable from the temporal variability of jet positions. Various statistical measures suggest that applying wave drag only within a fixed distance from the seafloor is not detrimental to the model performance relative to observations. However, the introduction of a novel diagnostic suggests that one way to improve the wave drag parameterization is to allow the vertical deposition of lee wave momentum flux to be spatially heterogeneous.},

abstract = {Abstract The frequency change in internal gravity waves upon scattering from a rough topography is investigated analytically. For this, sets of appropriate and tractable governing equations for various parameter regimes are derived using the method of multiple scales under the assumption that the amplitude of the bottom topography is small. A solution is shown for a simple case in which an incident internal wave is approximately linear and monochromatic. The solution has the following features: the intrinsic frequencies of the scattered waves are given as the sum and difference of the incident-wave frequency and the Doppler shift (or lee-wave frequency). This Doppler shift causes the change in the frequency. Hence, the assumption of frequency conservation is not valid if the Doppler shift is significant, that is, when the horizontal scale of the bottom roughness (or the length scale in the plane of the slope) is on the order of or much less than that of the incident-wave flow excursion. This condition can be satisfied in a realistic parameter range. The occurrence of such a frequency change has the following implications: first, it affects the estimate of the boundary mixing induced by the scattering because the energy redistribution in the vertical wavenumber space on scattering differs from that estimated using the assumption of frequency conservation. This effect happens because for a given horizontal wavenumber, the change in the frequency alters the vertical wavenumber of the scattered waves through the dispersion relation. Furthermore, if the incident waves are not monochromatic, even the leading-order scattered waves cannot be obtained by the superposition of the solutions for all the Fourier components of the incident waves because of the difference in the Doppler shift. Second, the effects of the background flow associated with the incident and primary reflected waves are significant when the frequency change occurs such that the background flow can create a critical level and/or advect scattered waves. The former causes mixing and background-flow acceleration, and the latter is favorable for the amplification of the scattered waves through superposition. Third, the resulting energy redistribution in frequency space could modify the spectrum shape of the oceanic internal waves, which is considered to affect both interior and boundary mixing.},

On the nontraditional f plane, because of the horizontal component of the earth's rotation for waves of inertial band with frequencies slightly below the local inertial frequency f, there is a waveguide in the mixed layer confined from below by the pycnocline. It is argued that when the stratification is shallow these waves are most easily and strongly excited by varying winds as near-inertial oscillations (NIOs). These motions have been overlooked in previous studies because they are absent under the traditional approximation. The observations that employed buoys with thermistors, ADCPs, and two 16.3-MHz Wellen Radar (WERA) HF radars were carried out in the Gulf of Lion in April–June 2006. The observations support the theoretical picture: a pronounced inertial band response occurs only in the presence of shallow stratification and is confined ...},

The model, however, overestimated the energy level in about two-thirds of the simulated cases, because the slab model was forced with winds whose characteristic period was shorter than the damping time scale of the model at 1.5 d. At the observation site, due to typhoons and orographic effects, high-frequency wind forcing is quite common, as is the overestimation of the energy level in the slab model results. In short, a simple slab model with a damping time-scale of about 1.5 d would be enough to show that the local wind was the main energy source of the near-inertial energy in this area, but the model could not be used to accurately estimate the amount of the work done by the wind to the mixed layer.},

abstract = {The model used by Veronis (1956) to examine the response of the ocean to a transient applied wind stress is refined to include continuous stratification. This enables one to examine in detail the structure of oscillations of near-inertial frequency as they disperse both vertically and horizontally from a forced region, in order to see to what extent wind generation can account for the observed properties of inertial waves in the ocean documented both by Webster (1968) and in the present study. The amplitudes and intermittency of oscillations observed near the surface and also their rapid decay with depth can be explained by the model, and it is believed that they are indeed often wind-generated. The amount of energy put into such oscillations is nearly independent of the stratification and of the horizontal scale of the wind but is strongly influenced by its time dependence. Sudden changes in the wind field are of most importance in both generating and destroying inertial oscillations. The model cannot account for the amplitudes of inertial waves observed at great depths, and it is doubted whether such waves can be traced to the action of a single storm on the ocean surface. ?? 1970.},

abstract = {Inertial-period oscillations have been observed at all depths in oceans, seas and great lakes. The transient nature of inertial motions in the surface layer is easily explained by Ekman's theory with an impulsive wind. The duration of the wind, as compared with the inertial period, is the most important factor which governs the amplitude of the inertial motion. Data collected at the Bou??e-Laboratoire in the Mediterranean Sea are used in this paper to check this dependency. Theory shows that a spectral peak will be slightly displaced from the inertial frequency; the displacement depends on the eddy viscosity of seawater. ?? 1971.},

abstract = {Accurate estimate of ocean surface currents is both a challenging issue and a growing end-users requirement. In this paper ocean currents are calculated at two levels (surface and 15 m depth) as the sum of the geostrophic and Ekman components. First, a new, global, 1/4° Mean Dynamic Topography, called the CNES-CLS13 MDT, has been calculated and is now available for use by the oceanographic community. By exploiting information from surface drifters and Argo floats, the new MDT resolves spatial scales beyond the resolution permitted by the recent Gravity and Ocean Circulation Experiment (GOCE) geoid models (125 km). Associated mean geostrophic speeds in strong currents are increased by 200{\%} on average compared to GOCE-based mean currents. In addition, for the first time, a two-level, monthly, empirical Ekman model that samples a spiral-like behavior is estimated. We show that combining both pieces of information leads to improved ocean currents compared to other existing observed products.},

abstract = {Four years of sustained glider observations are used to compute the seasonal cycle of hydrographic fields in the central Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). Results reveal a large phase lag in near bottom temperatures, with peak values occurring in September at the inner shelf, in October at the mid shelf, and in November at the outer shelf. Unlike the northern MAB, the seasonal cycle explains over 70{\%} of the near-surface salinity variability. At the inner shelf and offshore near the bottom, however, most of the variance is due to pulses in river discharge and to shifts in the position of the shelfbreak front. Cross-shelf density gradients inshore of the 60-m isobath are dominated by salinity during winter and spring, with temperature contributing significantly from August to October. This is because bottom waters near the coast are warm due to the deepening of the thermocline during fall, but offshore waters are still influenced by the cold pool. The vertical stratification seasonal variability is also large. Early in the year, stratification is small and entirely due to salinity. By May, salinity still dominates vertical gradients near the coast, but temperature and salinity contribute equally to the density stratification offshore. During summer, stratification is dominated by temperature. Temperature interannual variability was small during the sampling period, but surface salinity was anomalously low by 1.2 psu in summer 2006. The anomaly was due to larger than average discharge from the Hudson River in early summer during a period of strong upwelling favorable winds. },

@article{Austin2002,
abstract = {A two-dimensional numerical model is used to study the response to upwelling- and downwelling-favorable winds on a shelf with a strong pycnocline. During upwelling or downwelling, the pycnocline intersects the surface or bottom, forming a front that moves offshore. The characteristics of the front and of the inner shelf inshore of the front are quite different for upwelling and downwelling. For a constant wind stress the upwelling front moves offshore at roughly a constant rate, while the offshore displacement of the downwelling front scales as because the thickness of the bottom layer increases as the front moves offshore. The geostrophic alongshelf t transport in the front is larger during downwelling than upwelling for the same wind stress magnitude because the geostrophic shear is near the bottom in downwelling as opposed to near the surface in upwelling. During upwelling, weak stratification is maintained over the inner shelf by the onshore flux of denser near-bottom water. This weak stratification suppresses vertical mixing, causing a small reduction in stress at mid depth that drives a weak cross-shelf circulation over the inner shelf. For constant stratification, the inner shelf stratification and cross-shelf circulation are stronger. During downwelling on an initially stratified shelf, the inner shelf becomes unstratified because the very weak cross-shelf circulation forces lighter water under denser, driving convection which enhances the vertical mixing. As a result the stress is nearly constant throughout the water column and the cross-shelf circulation is slightly weaker than in the initially unstratified case. The downwelling response is essentially the same for the constant stratification and the two-layer cases. Model runs including the evolution of a passive tracer indicate that the inner shelf region acts as a barrier to cross-shelf transport of tracers from the coastal boundary to farther offshore and vice versa, due to strong vertical mixing and weak cross-shelf circulation in this region.},

abstract = {We use a high resolution nested ocean modelling system forced by synthetic atmospheric gravity waves to investigate Balearic meteotsunami generation, amplification and propagation properties. We determine how meteotsunami amplitude outside and inside of the Balearic port of Ciutadella depends on forcing gravity wave direction, speed and trajectory. We quantify the contributions of Mallorca shelves and Menorca Channel for different gravity wave forcing angles and speeds. The Channel is demonstrated to be the key build-up region determining meteotsunami amplitude in Ciutadella while northern and southern Mallorca shelves serve mostly as barotropic wave guides but do not significantly contribute to seiche amplitude in Ciutadella. This fact seriously reduces early-warning alert times in cases of locally generated pressure perturbations. We track meteotsunami propagation paths in the Menorca Channel for several forcing velocities and show that the Channel bathymetry serves as a focusing lens for meteotsunami waves whose paths are constrained by the forcing direction. We show that faster meteotsunamis propagate over deeper ocean regions, as required by Proudman resonance. We estimate meteotsunami speed under sub- and supercritical forcing and derive a first order estimate of its magnitude. We show that meteotsunamis, generated by supercritical gravity waves, propagate with a velocity which is equal to an arithmetic mean of the forcing velocity and local barotropic ocean wave speed.},

An estimate of the entrainment buoyancy flux scaling is made to best fit the LES results. The presence of Stokes drift forcing and the resulting Langmuir turbulence enhances the entrainment rate significantly under weak surface destabilizing buoyancy flux conditions, i.e., weakly convective turbulence. In contrast, Langmuir turbulence effects are moderate when convective turbulence is dominant and appear to be additive rather than multiplicative to the convection-induced mixing. The parameterized unresolved velocity scale in the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) is modified to adhere to the new scaling law of the entrainment buoyancy flux and account for the effects of Langmuir turbulence.

abstract = {Langmuir turbulence is a boundary layer oceanographic phenomenon of the upper layer that is relevant to mixing and vertical transport capacity. It is a manifestation of imposed aerodynamic stresses and the ag-gregate horizontal velocity profile due to orbital wave motion (the so-called Stokes profile), resulting in streamwise-elongated, counterrotating cells. The majority of previous research on Langmuir turbulence has focused on the open ocean. Here, we investigate the characteristics of coastal Langmuir turbulence by solving the grid-filtered Craik–Leibovich equations where the distinction between open and coastal conditions is a product of additional bottom boundary layer shear. Studies are elucidated by visualizing Langmuir cell vortices using isosurfaces of Q. We show that different environmental forcing conditions control the length scales of coastal Langmuir cells. We have identified regimes where increasing the Stokes drift velocity and decreasing surface wind stress both act to change the horizontal size of coastal Langmuir cells. Furthermore, wavenumber is also responsible in setting the horizontal extent L s of Langmuir cells. Along with that, wavenumber that is linked to the Stokes depth d s controls the vertical extent L ssv h of small-scale vortices embedded within the upwelling limb, while the downwelling limb occupies the depth of the water column H for any coastal surface wave forcing (i.e., L d h 5 H and L ssv h ; d s). Additional simulations are included to demonstrate insensitivity to the grid resolution and aspect ratio.},

@article{Taylor2010,
abstract = {In this study, the influence of a geostrophically balanced horizontal density gradient on turbulent con- vection in the ocean is examined using numerical simulations and a theoretical scaling analysis. Starting with uniform horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients, convection is driven by imposing a heat loss or a desta- bilizing wind stress at the upper boundary, and a turbulent layer soon develops. For weak lateral fronts, turbulent convection results in a nearly homogeneous mixed layer (ML) whose depth grows in time. For strong fronts, a turbulent layer develops, but this layer is not an ML in the traditional sense because it is characterized by persistent horizontal and vertical gradients in density. The turbulent layer is, however, nearly homogeneous in potential vorticity (PV), with a value near zero. Using the PV budget, a scaling for the depth of the turbulent low PV layer and its time dependence is derived that compares well with numerical simu- lations. Two dynamical regimes are identified. In a convective layer near the surface, turbulence is generated by the buoyancy loss at the surface; below this layer, turbulence is generated by a symmetric instability of the lateral density gradient. This work extends classical scalings for the depth of turbulent boundary layers to account for the ubiquitous presence of lateral density gradients in the ocean. The new results indicate that a lateral density gradient, in addition to the surface forcing, can affect the stratification and the rate of growth of the surface boundary layer.},

@article{Gerbi2009,
abstract = {Observations of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dynamics in the ocean surface boundary layer are presented here and compared with results from previous observational, numerical, and analytic studies. As in previous studies, the dissipation rate of TKE is found to be higher in the wavy ocean surface boundary layer than it would be in a flow past a rigid boundary with similar stress and buoyancy forcing. Estimates of the terms in the turbulent kinetic energy equation indicate that, unlike in a flow past a rigid boundary, the dissipation rates cannot be balanced by local production terms, suggesting that the transport of TKE is important in the ocean surface boundary layer. A simple analytic model containing parameterizations of production, dissipation, and transport reproduces key features of the vertical profile of TKE, including enhancement near the surface. The effective turbulent diffusion coefficient for heat is larger than would be expected in a rigid-boundary boundary layer. This diffusion coefficient is predicted reasonably well by a model that contains the effects of shear production, buoyancy forcing, and transport of TKE (thought to be related to wave breaking). Neglect of buoyancy forcing or wave breaking in the parameterization results in poor predictions of turbulent diffusivity. Langmuir turbulence was detected concurrently with a fraction of the turbulence quantities reported here, but these times did not stand out as having significant differences from observations when Langmuir turbulence was not detected.},
